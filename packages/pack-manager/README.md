# Domain Pack Manager

Shared installation store for Desktop and CLI. It verifies Ed25519 signed HTTPS catalogs,
archive SHA-256, every file and required Skill/provider/runtime entry before atomically activating
a Domain version. A task lease prevents changing or removing a Domain while in use. Failed,
corrupt and unsupported updates preserve the previous active version.

New installs retain an integrity receipt; scanning checks the complete resource inventory,
content hashes and ordinary file boundaries, isolating damaged Domains. Older API 1 installs
without receipts remain readable and receive a receipt on reinstall. The local owner can edit
both the store and receipts; these checks detect damaged resources, not a malicious local owner.

`INDUSTRIAL_HARNESS_PACK_STORE` overrides `~/.industrial-agent-harness/packs`.
`scripts/build-pack-distribution.cjs` assembles unchanged resources from the pinned owner release into public distribution bundles, including license
materials. PCB's private source and complete Skill remain external; the public bridge records
fixed resource provenance and loads authorized local resources only when selected.
Production catalogs require `HARNESS_PACK_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` and `HARNESS_PACK_SIGNING_KEY_ID`.

Core-owned optional `.hpack` files may also ship inside the application resources; their catalog is protected by the Core application signature, and installation verifies the pinned archive hash. This source is supplied only by the desktop main process, never a renderer or project path. Signed HTTPS catalogs remain the update source.

Optional `runtimeAssets` declarations prepare pinned macOS arm64 vendor applications in `<store>/.runtime-assets/`: streaming HTTPS download, exact size/SHA-256, read-only DMG mount or validated ZIP extraction, full app copy with upstream licenses, signature verification, bounded version probe, atomic activation and repair. Large applications remain separate from bounded `.hpack` archives. Interrupted staging is not ready; versions and the verified download cache are retained. Removing a Pack preserves this reusable runtime cache. Desktop and CLI use the same resolved dependency environment.

Installation does not execute archive installer scripts. Registered runtime modules execute later as
trusted code, through shared runtime execution and verification boundaries. Broker disclosure
and archive signatures do not provide a generic sandbox for arbitrary third-party code.

See [Pack format](../../doc/domain-pack.md) and the [independent authoring tutorial](../../doc/pack-authoring.md).
The owned `examples/review-pack` demonstrates dynamic Skill-only installation without changing Core.
Validation: `node scripts/check-pack-release.cjs`.

Managed macOS runtime recipes support `macos-app-dmg` and `macos-app-zip`. `app` is the installed bundle name;
optional `archiveApp` locates a nested bundle in the vendor archive. `environmentExecutables` maps additional
`INDUSTRIAL_HARNESS_*` variables to executable files inside that app. All mapped files are checked against
receipt hashes; one damaged file makes the runtime unavailable until repaired. Recipes remain owned by
Domain Packs. ZIP preparation validates central/local headers, paths, file types, expanded size and duplicates
before extraction; links in ZIP archives are rejected. DMG app links must resolve within the app. Both formats
retain upstream code-signature verification and a bounded isolated version probe before activation.

New recipes declare `installedSize` in bytes. `RuntimeAssetManager.estimate(assets)` and
`PackManager.estimate(entry)` return `downloadBytes`, `installedBytes`, `requiredBytes`, `availableBytes`,
`estimated` and `cacheReused`. The required space includes staging and a reserve; existing installations are
retained during replacement. Legacy recipes without installed sizes receive a conservative estimate marked
`estimated: true`. Display estimates conservatively include archives until their hashes have been verified;
preparation reuses verified cache and checks the real destination filesystem with `statfs` before downloading
or copying. A failed check preserves existing active versions.

Preparation progress identifies `checking-space`, `downloading`, `verifying`, `mounting`, `extracting`,
`copying`, `checking`, `activating` and `ready`. Download events include measured `bytesPerSecond` and
`etaSeconds` when computable; non-download phases do not claim a percentage. Cancellation or failed checks
leave incomplete staging unactivated and release the preparation lock. Completed archives are retained for
retry and repair; partial downloads are removed. These contracts are covered by Pack Manager tests, including
a real HTTPS transfer and, on macOS, native extraction of a small ZIP fixture. Synthetic vendor probes do not
establish engineering qualification or support for additional platforms.

Footprint-only metadata updates preserve existing runtime receipts. A changed execution recipe for the same
vendor archive receives a separate installation directory, so a cancelled Pack activation cannot invalidate
the runtime used by its active predecessor. Native cancellation waits for confirmed child exit before staging
cleanup; even a partially successful mount is detached, and a still-mounted source is never traversed for deletion.

Task leases and installation ownership are acquired under the same store lock. A task cannot start using a
domain being prepared or repaired by another process, and preparation cannot begin while that domain has a
live task lease. Unrelated installed domains remain usable. Failure to write a lock owner releases the file
and descriptor so installation can be retried after freeing disk space.
